    Hello, my name is Manh Nguyen and I am from Saint Louis, Missouri. I am a senior pursuing a BS in Information Technology from Mizzou. I have web development experience from taking IT 2830 and an internship teaching Javascript. My expectations from this course is to improve my frontend development skills, as it is my greatest weakness in terms of web development, and to earn a certificate. I hope to improve these skills because I want to be a full stack web developer when I graduate from college. During my free time, I like to play video games, such as Lost Ark, League of Legends, and Minecraft. When I am not playing video games, I love to spend time with my friends and girlfriend. I also love to travel and eat food from different countries, despite being a picky eater.
