            My college experience can only be described as something that cannot be replicated unless the world falls into another pandemic. My freshman year started off rocky because of the typical transition from high school to college. Once I successfully transitioned, Covid-19 sent me home for a week, and then two weeks, and then everything transitioned online. This transition was easier for IT and CS majors compared to other majors because most classes were already online before the pandemic, but classes that were in person before the pandemic was a harder adjustment, for both the students and the professor. The professor had to learn how to use Zoom and every student had to transition to remote learning. After everything and now that we are back on campus, I look back and realize how much the pandemic affected me and my education. It taught me to become a better person overall and because of this experience, one of my career goals is to get a remote job because I liked the feeling of working in the comfort of my own space.

            My freshman year of college proved to be very diffcult for me. It was very overwhelming for me at first coming from a very small and tight knit high school to a huge campus with hundreds of students. This also made it diffuclt for me to make friends at first because I wasn't really sure of how to put myself out there. Not only was this an issue, but I also struggled a bit my first semester because I was taking Calculus 1 and CS 1050, which is a class known for weeding kids out. It was hard, but luckily I got through it. After awhile I started to follow a schedule and make friends and it all started to feel like what I expected college to feel like. I'm glad that I was able to go through this experience as a student and as a person because it allowed me to learn and grow.

            Just when I thought I had finally adapted to college life, sophomore year hit. Covid-19 came out as a worldwide pandemic and quickly transitioned us to online-learning. This was a harder transition than the transtion from high school to college, because despite everything, I was used to being around people and having teachers closeby for help. During this time, I was still  taking General Education classes with my major classes. I found that my Computer Science and IT classes were and easy transition  online, but General Education classes are originally structured to be taught in-person, with in person classes, activities, and examinations. However, things started to look up as teachers and students got used to online-learning and vaccines began to be distributed. With this, I was able to see a few friends and get a little more sunlight, which helped my mental health and academic attitude tremdeously.

            I had finally gotten used to the new way of living after Coivd-19, but remnants of it still remained. During my junior year, all my classes were still online, which has its perks, but now two years of my college experience have been spent sitting behind a computer. I know this is quite ironic since my career will consist of me sitting behind a computer all day, but I didn't expect college to be like this. I was able to learn a lot during this time, such as Blender and After Effects which were both really fun to learn and improved my product management skills in the mean time. During this time, I really started to feel more and more confident about my coding skills and I started to actually feel like a developer. The summer following junior year, I was able to put my skills to work with the internship I accquired with Color Coded Kids. Here, I was an Intern Instrutor, and was able to come up with coding lesson plans for a classroom of students. It was really fun being able to put my knowledge to the test while also being able to teach the next genreation how to code. This reminded me of why I found what I do so interesting in the frist place.
