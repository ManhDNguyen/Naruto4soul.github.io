    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
    <p>The goal of this website is to show my future and possible employers my skills and experience as a web developer. I will showcase all my past achievements with explanations of my skills and projects. It will also list the extent of my education and the classes I have taken that corresponds with my skills. My goal for this website is to make it easy to navigate, display my experience through a way that not only shows my skills through literature, but also through the design of the website. With wanting to improve my front-end development skills in mind, my main goal for this websiteâ€™s design is for it to smoothly transfer between a computer and a mobile device. I do not want the accessibility of the website to change from one platform to another, but rather it will be compatible will all internet-accessed devices. Another goal is to make the website compatible with all monitor sizes as well, instead of it being hard to navigate and read.
