            Hello, my name is Manh Nguyen, and I am from Vietnam. I moved to the Saint Louis, Missouri when I was eight years old. I graduated from Metro Academic and Classical High School. It is ranked the number one high school in Missouri. I am now a senior pursuing a BS in Information Technology from University of Missouri in Columbia. My planned graduation date is May 2023, and I will also be graduating with 4 Certificates in Cyber security, Web and Mobile applications development, media technology design and Information systems and technology. I plan to be a full stack web developer when I graduate, which is why I chose to pursue all those certificates while in school. Specifically, after graduation, I would like to work with a gaming company as a full stack developer because gaming is my passion, and it is what pushed me to pursue my dreams in developing.
